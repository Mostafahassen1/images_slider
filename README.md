## Purpose

This project is a simple image slider designed to practice basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery functionality. The slider allows users to view images one at a time and navigate through them using previous and next buttons.

## Features

- **Image Display**: The slider displays a series of images, one at a time.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Users can navigate through images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: The slider is centered and styled with basic CSS to fit within a fixed width.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
   - `index.html`: The HTML file containing the slider structure.
   - `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the slider.
   - `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles slider functionality.
   - Images for the slider, such as `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`, `image4.jpg`, and `image5.jpg`.
   - Arrow images for navigation, such as `arrow-prev.png` and `arrow-next.png`.

2. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file sets up the basic layout of the slider with navigation arrows and image placeholders.

3. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file styles the slider and images. It sets the width, height, and display properties for the slider and images.

4. **JavaScript/jQuery Functionality**:
   - The `script.js` file uses jQuery to handle the click events for the navigation buttons.
   - Clicking the "Next" button displays the next image in the sequence.
   - Clicking the "Previous" button displays the previous image in the sequence.

5. **Running the Slider**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the image slider.
